#Overview

Performed analysis on PH employee to provide a detailed understanding of the upcoming wave of retirements for the company. 

##Major Takeaways 

- Silver Tsunami is aptly called a tsunami, it should be a matter of concern for the CEO and HR Department. It is recommended that PH take appropriate measures to smoothly transition their workforce to a younger generation. The severity of this issue needs a well planned prorgram over the next few years. I recommend assigning a task force consisting of recruiters and human resources professionals oversee the program. 
- The planned mentorship program can be effective, however, those eligible to undertake mentorship responsibilities are few in numbers in contrast to the number of positions opening up. Unfortunately, there aren't enough elegible employees for this position. There should be incentives for those who are elegible to be part of the proposed program.  PH has 72458 employees on the verge of retiring and only 1549 employees eligible to provide mentorship for new hires and newly promoted employees. It is critical to get over 90% of the eligible employees to sign up for the program and that can be done with through incentives. 
- As mentioned above, it is established that there aren't enough eligible employees for the mentorship program. Therefore, I suggest that PH should work on hiring contract trainers as part of the said program. 
- The Table named 'retiring_titles' which is also included as a CSV file with the same name serves as a good guideline on what positions to focus on for hiring and promoting. Senior Engineer and Senior staff will be the two most affected positions within the company.

##Summary

The silver Tsunami needs a proactive approach or it will negatively affect the operations across all departments. In total there will be 72458 position open due to retirement in the coming year, the number of employees eligible for becoming mentors is simply not enough for the mentorship program to be successful. PH should look into hiring consultants or contract employees to fill the gap for training. It will be helpful if there were two more queries done on this data. One two show the number employees retiring each year and another to break it down by departments.
